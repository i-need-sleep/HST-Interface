To run the app:
	Run dist/app/app 
	Three browser windows should pop up after the model is loaded, one for each candidate layout.

Entering a progression:
	Add chord: adds a duplicate of the currently selected node, chord suggestions will be displayed for the new node.
	Suggest chord: fetches likely extensions of the selected chord n-gram from Hooktheory (if applicable). Clicking a suggested chord adds it to the progression.
	Clicking an already selected node calls out the chord dial for quick chroma edits.
	Edit chord: for further editing of root/bass/chroma.
	The currently selected path is highlighted in blue.
	Select the end node of a complete progression and click save to save it to the progression stack.

Chord table:
	Clicking a chord cell plays the corresponding chord
	progression: plays the entire progression (chord only)
	
	Layout-wise differences
	Layout A (http://127.0.0.1:5000/):
		Clicking the head of each row also plays the entire progression
	Layout B (http://127.0.0.1:5000/layoutB):

		Play: apply and play
	Layout C (http://127.0.0.1:5000/layoutC):
